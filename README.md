# MAYN! MAYN! MAYN! - If it was completed on time
## An auction web app where you have to say "MINE!" to place a bid

### What is this branch?
Since they hackathon is done, the APIs will probably be removed,
soooo, since I now have an idea on what to build and what tools
to use it with, this branch is dedicated to it.

And since there's still a lot of bugs in Pilon, the schemas will
be recreated at Hasura.

### What is this?
Well, it's a web app that has buy and sell feature and can do auction stuff

### Why did you create this mess?
Its an entry to the JAMstack Hackathon 2018, the online hackathon, not the inperson cuz
me got no kaching.
also i want to learn how to use JAMstack and serverless APIs, they're berry awsum.

### Wha didya use, m8?
- Gatsby
- react-bootstrap
- bootstrap
- netlify for the hosting
- Hasura and heroku for the real time db with graphql
That's supposed to be the plan, but errors & bugs and me being slow at learning stuff, made this
thing a web app with signup and login. 
THis is sooo sed, ALEXA. PLAY DETPATITO
